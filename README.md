## Hey, guys! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
# How are you? I hope you are well, welcome to my profile. 

I am passionate, I love and live programming, and I always seek to improve and intensify my learning, always challenging myself and learning new things.
The programming made me see that the world is not the same as before I met it, and I experience this with every line of code made.
I am very optimistic with my goals, dreams and especially with the goals that I trace to my inner self. The main one is always to fight my biggest enemy, yesterday's self. I try to be better day after day, in every way, in the professional, personal, social, and my family! This is my essence and what defines me.
I always keep myself informed and updated, and I always try to learn about what I don't know, and of course, to go even deeper into the things I already know. I love to stimulate my ability to solve problems and my creativity.
